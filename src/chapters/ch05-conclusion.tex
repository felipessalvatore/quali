\chapter{Future Work}
\label{ch05:futurework}

Future work will explore two branches: on the one hand, we need to finish the Entailment-QA corpus to have a fine grain analysis of the result that we are seeing on the SICK corpus; on the other hand, we need to explore the different extensions for all mentioned models \cite{MaCKZRSG17, Serban:2016a} before inferring any kind of limitation of the current set of QA models.
